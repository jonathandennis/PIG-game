# PIG-game
GAME RULES:

- The game has two players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their current ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all of the current ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next players turn.
- The current player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next players turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
